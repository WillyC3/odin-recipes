 <!-- Description -->
 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>
  The birth of this fiery dish is more ironic than anything. It is believed the spouse of a man named Thorton Prince suspected he was having an affair because of his late returns home. She decided to put a large amount of cayenne pepper in with his chicken to get back at him. Prince ended up loving it and opened up the first Nashville Hot Chicken shop know as "Prince's Hot Chicken Shack", which is now ran by Prince's great niece.
  <br />
  This name of this dish is self explanitory as it is simply spicy chicken.

 <!-- Steps -->
 <h2>Steps</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>Arrange chicken pieces in a large bowl.</li>
  <li>Whisk buttermilk, pickle brine, hot sauce, and egg together in a mixing bowl. Pour marinade over chicken and stir to ensure each piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and let chicken marinate in refrigerator 2 to 4 hours.</li>
  <li>Mix flour and salt together in a shallow flat dish. Remove chicken from marinade and blot with paper towels. Reserve marinade. Toss chicken in flour until thoroughly coated. Return chicken to marinade, coating all sides; remove chicken from marinade allowing excess to drip back into the bowl. Coat the chicken once again in flour mixture. Place on a rack. Repeat with all chicken pieces. Allow to sit out about 15 minutes to allow coating to dry out a bit.</li>
  <li>Place butter and lard in a large pot. Add cayenne pepper, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, kosher salt, and black pepper. Place over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until fats melt. Remove from heat; keep sauce warm.</li>
  <li>Fill cast iron skillet about 1/3 of the way with vegetable oil. Heat oil to 350 degrees F over medium-high heat. Carefully place chicken into hot oil, skin side down. Maintain an oil temperature of 325 degrees F, adjusting heat as need. Fry until instant read thermometer reads 160 degrees F, 8 to 10 minutes per side.</li>
  <li>Transfer chicken to a rack to drain. Brush with the sauce on both sides.</li>
  <li>Enjoy!</li>
